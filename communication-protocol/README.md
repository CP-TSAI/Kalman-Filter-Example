# Communication Protocol

### Steps for the Sample Code

- Create Virtual Serial Port (by the following youtube link)  

- Use g++ compile the code, and run with input file name (./serial_port.out sample_command.txt)  

- Open two terminals, use "cat" to check if it runs correctly!

- Radar UART Protocol:
```
115200 bps, Data 8 bits, Parity None, Stop 1 bit, Flow control None
```




### TCP/UDP




### Some Notes

- Use "cat" and "echo" to check the connectivity of ports
